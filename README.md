# 🌼 Flower Journaling – Mental Health Interactive Garden

Flower Journaling is a 3D mental health-focused journaling experience where users "grow" a unique flower each day by writing journal entries and answering a set of questions. Each flower is a reflection of a specific day and mood, creating a peaceful, interactive garden filled with personal reflections and colorful symbolism.

## 🧠 Project Idea

This project was created during a hackathon centered around **mental health**. Our concept merges **daily journaling** with a **3D environment**, where the act of expressing yourself leads to the growth of a flower—visually representing your thoughts and feelings.

- 📝 **Journal entries** serve as the stem of the flower.
- ❓ **Ten multiple-choice questions** color the petals based on your answers.
- 🌸 **3D garden** allows you to explore flowers from past days, read journal entries, and grow new flowers.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **TypeScript / JavaScript**
- **Vite** (frontend dev server & build tool)
- **TailwindCSS** (for styling)
- **Drizzle ORM** (potential database layer)
- **3D graphics engine** (e.g., Three.js, integration pending)
- C++ files (original logic for journaling and questions)
